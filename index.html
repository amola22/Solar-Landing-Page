                        come cheap. Our aim is to make solar power accessible to
                        everyone, so we price ourselves in a way that makes
                        solar energy more affordable. We're focused on helping
                        you and on helping the environment, rather than on
                        turning a profit.</p>

                    <p>As we've said, we do this because we truly care about the
                        planet and about seeing people embrace a greener, more
                        eco-friendly approach to power. The world of green
